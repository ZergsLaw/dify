<legal_info>
### Forms available for foreign ownership in Indonesia.

- The first - **leasehold** - is a long-term rental of the land under a property.

The lease duration depends on the agreement between the developer and the previous landowner (usually Indonesians). The standard leasehold format assumes that the buyer receives the land under the property for **25-30 years**, with the option to renew for **another 25-30 years**. Some developers offer even longer terms.

With a payback period of 5-10 years, the net profit may be 50 years at the most. For such deal, the investor _does not need to rely on local mediators_: leasehold deals are simplified as much as possible for buyers. Once the leasehold period expires, the land is automatically transferred back to the previous owner. However, the law allows to relocate the property to another location. Leasehold can be resold or inherited.

- The second option is **freehold**, allowing ownership for **80 years**.

According to local laws, _foreigners cannot register a freehold_ for themselves as an individual. The real estate property will require the buyer to become a legal entity and open a company in Indonesia, plus be able to be present physically in Bali during the deal. The investor (client) becomes the founder of the company, and the co-founder can be a co-investor. At the same time, the company must be real and submit accounting reports. The object of purchase under freehold becomes on the balance of the opened company.

There is a small feature, if the freehold-object is being resold in 5-7 years and put on the balance sheet of another company, the holding period of 80 years is reset. Freehold is not popular among foreigners. Firstly, due to the complexity of registration, which cannot be done remotely. Secondly, because of the high price. The land price under a similar leasehold object will be three times lower.

### Forms available for ownership to Indonesian citizens.

- The first one is also **leasehold** - it is a long-term rental of land under a real estate property. There are no **differences** in the registration of such type of ownership **between foreign citizens and Indonesian citizens**.
- The second way - **freehold.** The difference in this form of ownership for Indonesian citizens - they **don't need to open a company**. They can register a freehold on themselves as an individual.

---

The procedure for a foreign company to purchase an asset in Indonesia differs depending on the stage of development of the property. Here is how it may look like:

### Pre-sale purchase (Pre-sale)

1. **Selecting the asset and determining the sale format:** At the initial stage of project development, when the property has not yet been built, the seller sets the terms of sale. In Indonesia, an investment contract is often used, which a foreign company, such as from the US, can sign directly. This avoids the unnecessary costs and taxes associated with setting up a subsidiary during the construction phase.
2. **Signing the investment contract:** The US company signs the contract directly with the developer, stipulating all key aspects of the project, including the timeframe for completion, payment terms and transfer of rights to the future property. 3 Payment: Payment is made in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the investment agreement.

_This approach allows the foreign company the flexibility to manage the investment in the early stages of the project without the need to establish a PT PMA subsidiary until construction is completed and the property is ready for operation._

### Buying a completed property

When a property in Indonesia is fully built and ready for use, sellers and buyers can choose one of the following approaches depending on their strategic goals and preferences:

1. Management through the seller:
    - This option is suitable if the seller offers the services of a management company. Upon completion of construction, the asset is transferred to the MC, which becomes the tax agent.
    - The income from the asset is distributed directly between the parties according to the terms of the management agreement. This simplifies the income generation process and reduces the tax burden.
2. Registration of the property to the buyer's PT PMA subsidiary:
    - If buyers prefer to control the property directly and optimize asset management, the establishment of a PT PMA subsidiary in Indonesia can be arranged.
    - The subsidiary company registers the asset in its own name, which gives full control over the management and operation of the property. At any stage, PT PMA can hand over the management of the asset to a management company, optimizing operating costs and improving the return on investment.

_Each of these approaches is customized to meet local legal requirements and tax regulations, ensuring efficient and legal investment management._

---

### **Rights and obligations of owners**

Owning real estate through PT PMA imposes certain rights and responsibilities:

**1. Ownership rights:** PT PMA can own real estate under the rights of Hak Guna Bangunan (building right) and Hak Milik (land right), which allows for commercial activities.

**2. Protection of property rights:** Indonesian law protects the rights of owners, but requires strict compliance with all procedures and conditions for registration of rights.

**3. Management responsibilities:** Owners are required to maintain the property in accordance with local environmental regulations and standards.

---

## Inheritance.

In Indonesia, inheritance is regulated by three legal systems:

- Adat (traditional law)
- Islamic law (Miras)
- Civil law

The application of a particular legal system depends on the religion of the testator and their heirs. Islamic law applies to Muslim families, adat law to Balinese families, and civil law to Christian families or those of mixed religious backgrounds, or if there is a foreign heir involved.

Inheritance can occur either by law or by will.

### **According to the law, a person may be considered an heir:**

- By way of representation.

However, not all individuals can be considered heirs even under a will. The term "unworthy heir" refers to individuals deprived of the right of inheritance due to certain actions:

### The following are not considered heirs under any circumstances:

1. Persons who have committed murder or attempted murder of the testator.
2. Persons who slandered the testator during their lifetime.
3. Persons who threatened or coerced the testator to make or refuse to make a will.
4. Persons who deliberately concealed, destroyed, or falsified a will.

Individuals declared "unworthy heirs" who have already inherited are obligated to return all property and income obtained from it, starting from the moment of the inheritance being opened.

If an heir is recognized as unworthy even after the will has been made or opened, they are excluded from inheritance. In this case, inheritance occurs by right of representation. The closest relatives inherit after the unworthy heir. If the unworthy heir is a spouse or their children, the inheritance moves to the 2nd line of inheritance.

### There are four lines of heirs in Indonesian law:

1. Spouse, children of the testator, and grandchildren in the descending line.
2. Parents of the testator, the testator's siblings, and their children in the descending line.
3. Grandparents of the testator (both maternal and paternal), and great-grandparents in the ascending line.
4. Aunts, uncles of the testator (both maternal and paternal), their descendants up to the 6th generation, as well as siblings of the testator's grandparents and their descendants up to the 6th generation.

If there are no heirs from the aforementioned lines, the property is considered escheat and becomes owned by the state. The Inherited Property Committee manages the escheated property on behalf of the state.

Under Indonesian law, the term for inheritance is 3 years.

### There are four groups of individuals disqualified from obtaining any share in an inheritance (whether by will or by inheritance by law):

1. A medical doctor who provided treatment to the testator before their death.
2. The notary who drafted the will.
3. Witnesses who attended the drafting of the will. (In Indonesia, only testimonies verified by at least two witnesses are considered evidence. The testimony of a single witness is not admissible in either civil or criminal cases.)
4. A priest who heard the confession (or performed another, similar religious procedure) of the testator before their death.

These restrictions are in place to limit the possibility of these individuals using their authority for selfish purposes by influencing the testator's decision.

### In Indonesian law, there are 3 ways of inheriting:

1. Direct (unconditional) inheritance. This type of inheritance arises from the heir's status under the will, or when the heir directly and openly accepts the inheritance (for example, by beginning to manage the testator's property, paying off their debts, etc.).
2. Inheriting with a condition (conditional inheritance). In this type of inheritance, the heir is obliged to fulfill certain conditions, such as paying the testator's debts to creditors. In this case, the heir repays the testator's debts exclusively from the inherited property. The debts are "attached" to the inherited estate and do not transfer to the heir's property.
3. Inheritance Waiver. The heir has the right to refuse to receive the property by informing the president of the secretariat of the court at the place where the inheritance was opened. A corresponding record shall be made.

## Will.

A will is a unilateral act. The person who made the will can modify or revoke it at any time. However, a significant limitation is that the will must not contravene the law. The testator is not allowed to restrict the inheritance rights of individuals entitled to a compulsory share in the inheritance.

**The testator must be:**

1. A legal adult (over 18 years old).
2. Legally married, if the person is under 18 years of age (emancipated).
3. Of sound mind (must be able to understand their actions, etc.).

If the individual making the will is later declared legally incapacitated, the will can only be invalidated by a court decision. Foreigners in the Republic of Indonesia are allowed to make only "open wills". This means that a foreigner has the right to make only one type of will.

### Types of Wills:

1. Handwritten will - prepared and signed by the testator in their own hand.
2. Open (public) will - made by a notary in the presence of two witnesses.
3. Closed will - prepared by the testator in their own hand and personally handed to the notary in a sealed form, in the presence of 4 witnesses. Subsequently, it is sealed again in a special envelope and stamped with the notary's seal.

The tax system in Indonesia is a complex and controversial structure. One of the main difficulties is the contradiction between law and practice.

## Non-residents

For non-residents, the income tax rate is 20%.

## Residents

Residents are subject to a progressive tax rate based on their income level. The tax rate increases as income rises. The poorest groups of residents are exempt from paying taxes if their income does not exceed a certain amount.

Progressive tax rates based on income level:

- 5% for income up to 50 million rupees per year,
- 15% for income between Rp. 50 million and Rp. 250 million per year,
- 25% for income between Rp. 250 million and Rp. 500 million per year,
- 30% for income above Rp. 500 million per year.

The law defines Indonesian residents as those who stay in Indonesia for more than 183 days per year. However, in practice, this definition may not accurately reflect reality.

To obtain an NPWP (tax number), a foreign investor must have the status of an employee or business owner. For this purpose, they must have a KITAS (a residence permit not directly related to tax residency status) confirming their status.

However, it is important to consider double tax treaties. It may be that according to the tax treaty between Indonesia and the investor's country, taxes should be paid in their country of residence at the statutory rate.

Obtaining a tax number is often problematic for clients. Many have failed to obtain one, resulting in them paying taxes in their home country rather than in Indonesia.

---

In the Republic of Indonesia, tax laws for foreign companies, especially in the real estate sector, require careful planning and understanding of local regulations. Establishing a PT PMA allows foreign investors to take advantage of the local tax regime:

1. **Rental income tax:** rental income from real estate is set by the government at 10%.
2. **Taxes on real estate transactions:** A seller who receives income from the sale of an asset within the country pays 10% tax.

Tax incentives: The Republic of Indonesia provides tax incentives for new companies for 3 years - income tax at the rate of 0.5%.### Forms available for foreign ownership in Indonesia.

- 5% for income up to 50 million rupees per year,
- 15% for income between Rp. 50 million and Rp. 250 million per year,
- 25% for income between Rp. 250 million and Rp. 500 million per year,
- 30% for income above Rp. 500 million per year.

The law defines Indonesian residents as those who stay in Indonesia for more than 183 days per year. However, in practice, this definition may not accurately reflect reality.

To obtain an NPWP (tax number), a foreign investor must have the status of an employee or business owner. For this purpose, they must have a KITAS (a residence permit not directly related to tax residency status) confirming their status.

However, it is important to consider double tax treaties. It may be that according to the tax treaty between Indonesia and the investor's country, taxes should be paid in their country of residence at the statutory rate.

Obtaining a tax number is often problematic for clients. Many have failed to obtain one, resulting in them paying taxes in their home country rather than in Indonesia.

In the Republic of Indonesia, tax laws for foreign companies, especially in the real estate sector, require careful planning and understanding of local regulations. Establishing a PT PMA allows foreign investors to take advantage of the local tax regime:

1. **Rental income tax:** rental income from real estate is set by the government at 10%.
2. **Taxes on real estate transactions:** A seller who receives income from the sale of an asset within the country pays 10% tax.

Tax incentives: The Republic of Indonesia provides tax incentives for new companies for 3 years - income tax at the rate of 0.5%.
