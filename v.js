            "\n" +
            "In addition to Ecoverse itself, residents can enjoy all the infrastructure of Nuanu City. Here you'll find universities and a school with a prestigious Cambridge license. For those who value body care, there's an SPA center in Nuanu. Moreover, Nuanu provides unique opportunities for creative self-expression and event organization. Soon, the construction of the Oshom Hotel and Retreat Center is planned, including a 2,000-seat amphitheater and the already functioning Luna Beach Club. Special attention is paid to environmental protection. In order to preserve the ecology of the area, car traffic is prohibited here. Instead, there are parking lots, and you can get around the area by bicycles, electric cars, and buggies. This provides a calm and safe atmosphere for walking and active recreation.\n" +

            "\n" +
            "The project embodies the principles of environmental sustainability, creating an ideal space for living in harmony with nature. The complex employs the most modern technologies, such as solar panels, water purification and filtration systems, and rainwater collection for maintaining greenery. The complex is equipped with a \"Smart Home\" system, which automatically turns off lights, music, and appliances 10 minutes after leaving the room, significantly saving electricity.\n" +
            "\n" +

            "\n" +
            "## Construction\n" +
            "\n" +
            "One of the main advantages of the complex is its unparalleled and impeccable construction quality. The main supervision is carried out by a specialist with many years of experience working on projects such as Embassy in Australia, golf clubs in Bali, and impressive facilities in Dubai. Every stage of construction is carefully monitored and tested, including cement quality checks, reinforcement, and pile depth.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Ecoverse uses only the highest quality materials for this project. Class K-250 cement is used, which has much greater strength compared to the ordinary K-100 used in most construction projects in Bali. The buildings are designed to withstand earthquakes of magnitude 8 and above, with a 25-year warranty on the load-bearing structures.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "### What energy-saving technologies are used?\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Advanced technologies in Ecoverse construction do not compete with nature but harmoniously complement it. The residences feature smart home technology, triple water filtration, solar panels, waste collection and recycling, and rainwater use for irrigation.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Specifically for the project, a premium high-efficiency duct ventilation system by Mitsubishi was selected, which consumes 2 times less electricity than a standard split air conditioning system.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "High-quality insulation materials and lava stone coating on open areas ensure optimal temperature inside the residences, while air gaps between walls provide high sound insulation.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "This creates a balance of efficient resource use (up to 20% savings compared to ‚Äúregular‚Äù) and comfortable living.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "### What materials are used in finishing and construction?\n" +
            "\n" +
            "High-quality natural materials with high wear resistance are used in the construction and interiors of the residences. These include valuable types of wood, marble, glass, polished concrete, tiles, and natural stone.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Panoramic windows and high ceilings resonate with the tranquil green surroundings, creating space and light inside the premises. The architecture and finishes predominantly feature natural materials ‚Äì marble, valuable types of wood, and glass.\n" +

            "\n" +
            "Ecoverse offers a leasehold system for 28 years, with the possibility of extending for an additional 30 years after completion in October 2025. The initial down payment is only 35% of the cost, with the remaining amount paid in equal installments until the end of construction and project handover. Upon purchase, a 11% tax and 0.5% for notary services are also paid.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "To reserve a unit, a deposit of $5,000 is required. This amount is later deducted from the initial down payment of 35%. After reservation, the client must sign a contract within a week and make the first payment. \n" +
